# Printf
Eskindir Haileliul and Edwin Aboryo students of Software Engineering at Holborton School have developed the printf project. This project has some similar functionality and feature with the printf command found in the stdio.h library.

The "_printf()" function is a variadic function with the capability of receiving n number of arguments and format the output by replacing the format specifiers in the string.

| Specifier | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| c  | Character  |
| s  | String of characters  |
| %  | Precent character  |
| d or i | Signed decimal integer  |
